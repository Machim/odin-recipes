    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h4>Kotlet Schabowy (pron. ‘caught-let s-hab-ovy’) is a Polish-style Breaded Cutlet, made of pork loin (called ‘schab’ in Polish). </h3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 lb (900 g) boneless pork loin (pork chops / steaks)</li>
        <li>2 cups (475-500 ml) milk</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 onion, yellow or red</li>
        <li>3 dried bay leaves, optional</li>
        <li>3 all-spice berries, optional</li>
        <li>2 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>0.5 tbsp black pepper, ground</li>
        <li>1+¼ cup (160 g) flour, all-purpose</li>
        <li>1 cup (110 g) plain breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>Pork lard or clarified butter, for frying</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges, for serving, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h4>Marinattinh the meat</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Divide the meat into four (or eight) cutlets of equal thickness.</li>
        <li>Trim the exterior of any fat and sinew. If you leave it, it will cause the meat to shrink and curl during frying.</li>
        <li>Place the meat on a cutting board, one cutlet at the time. 
            Cover it with a layer of cling film (plastic wrap) and pound it with the flat side of a meat tenderizer. 
            The thickness will depend on individual preferences. Personally, I like them when they are roughly ¼ inch (5-6 mm) thick.
            Repeat with all the remaining cutlets.</li>
        <li>Pour the milk into a bowl, large enough to hold all the meat. </li>
        <li>Add in two garlic cloves (peeled and lightly crushed with a knife), thinly sliced onion, salt and pepper. 
            If you have dried bay leaves and all-spice berries in your pantry, add them as well. Stir everything together with a fork.</li>
        <li>Place the cutlets into the milky bowl. If they’re not covered well enough, you can top up the milk</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap (cling film) and refrigerate for 3-4 hours, and ideally overnight.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Breading & Frying</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Before continuing, pat the meat dry (using a paper towel), to remove any excessive moisture.</li>
        <li>Set up a breading station - for this process I use soup plates, but wide and shallow bowls are great too.
             Flour goes into one bowl, raw egg (whisked) into another, and the breadcrumbs into the last one.</li>
        <li>We’ll be working in batches: bread, fry, repeat. My cutlets are enormous, therefore I have to fry them one by one.</li>
        <li>Heat up the lard in a large frying pan (skillet) on medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Firstly, dredge both sides of each cutlet in flour, then dip in the beaten egg mixture, allowing the excess egg to drip. 
            Finally, dip it into the breadcrumbs, turning over to cover all sides. 
            I’m using a fork for the whole process (it’s easier and cleaner).</li>
        <li>Sauté each cutlet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. If it’s browning too quickly, reduce the heat.
             If the frying pan becomes too dry, add more lard. Repeat the process until you’re out of cutlets.</li>
        <li>To keep fried cutlets warm until you’re done with them all, you can cover them with aluminum foil, 
            or keep them in a warm oven.</li>
        <li>Before serving, pat each cutlet with a paper towel to remove any excessive fat.</li>
        <li>Serve while hot, with a lemon wedge on the side (optional)</li>
    </ol>
