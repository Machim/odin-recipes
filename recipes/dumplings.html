    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h4>These classic pierogi are everything you want in a dumpling: plump and pleasantly chewy, filled with soft potatoes and farmer’s cheese, nicely flavoured with fried onions and spices. It’s the most popular filling out there – bet you can’t eat just one!

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h4>FOR THE PIEROGI DOUGH</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Choose one of the dough recipes from here, or follow this basic instruction below.</li>
        <li>Sift the flour onto your work surface, make a well in the flour heap.</li>
        <li>Pour in a small amount of hot water. Knead together, adding more water gradually, so that the dough to becomes elastic and soft.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into parts. Take one part and roll it into a thin layer of dough. Cut it into circles using a glass.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>FOR THE POTATO AND CHEESE FILLING
    </h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes, rinse, place in a pot. Add salt, cover with cold water and bring to a boil. Cook under tender.</li>
        <li>Strain, put them back in the pot and mash them thoroughly while still hot. Make a smooth mass without lumps. Cool completely.</li>
        <li>Crush the cheese with a fork. Mix with potatoes, season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>FINISHING UP</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Salt the pot of water, bring to boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat. Drop pierogi in, 5-7 at the time. Cook for a few minutes (5-6) until the dumplings start to float. Collect with a slotted spoon. Continue until all pierogi are cooked.</li>
        <li>Peel & chop the onion. Melt some butter on a frying pan. Add the onion and brown it a bit.</li>
        <li>Add pierogi to the frying pan and fry them until golden.</li>
        <li>Serve on the plate. Top with remaining butter/onion mixture.</li>
